To create a set of Terraform modules for provisioning an AWS environment, we will follow these steps:

Create the modules for VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups.

Create a main configuration that uses these modules to provision the resources.

Externalize variables to make the modules reusable across different environments.

Version control the files and provide clear commit messages.
